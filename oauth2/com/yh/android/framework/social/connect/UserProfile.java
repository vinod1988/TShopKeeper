/**
 * A normalized model representing a service provider user profile.
 * The structure of a "UserProfile" varies across providers (see the difference between Facebook and Twitter, for example).
 * That said, there are generally a common set of profile fields that apply across providers.
 * This model provides access to those common fields in an uniform way.
 * This is particularly useful for pre-populating a local application registration form with provider profile data during a provider sign-in attempt.
